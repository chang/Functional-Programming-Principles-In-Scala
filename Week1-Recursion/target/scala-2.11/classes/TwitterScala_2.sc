/* Functions are Objects */
/*
The syntactic sugar of apply helps unify the duality of object and functional programming.

You can pass classes around and use them as functions and
  functions are just instances of classes under the covers.

Does this mean that every time you define a method in your class,
  youâ€™re actually getting an instance of Function*?

No, methods in classes are methods.
Methods defined standalone in the repl are Function* instances.
